            <p class="content">Corn is high in starch that provides 
                excellent energy and gut health for cattle which gives 
                consistent weight gain and growth. It also creates the 
                best marbling and fat content for a consistent taste and 
                provides a higher yield of meat.</p>

            <p class="content">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white 
                rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, 
                yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of 
                sushi are vegetarian</p>
